            <h2>5 Years Young<h2>
                <h3>Dad</h3>
                <p> Life goes by so fast. I get nervous I will just forget everything except what is in the present moment. I feel so sad when I think about that because all my best years are behind me. I feel excited about the future but remembering childhood makes me feel sad because I so wanted to be an adult. </p>
                <p>I was born in 1995 to a typical family. Mom, dad and a big sister. She was almost 3 years old when I was born. My mom was 27 or 28 when I was born and my dad two years older. I was always a very eager to please child. I had a learned fear of my father but me did have a lot of moments that I cherish. I see them again when he holds my son. It makes me long for those moments again.</p>
                <p> Of being a young girl being held by her dad and so wanting him to stop but loving every second of it. When he would do something called "Crab legs" It was something where if I walked in front of him he would clamp his legs around me and hold me there. Sometimes he would say "You're in jail pay the daddy tax." I never really understood what he was saying.  I remember I hated it so much. But I always  would walk just close enough and when he would do it I would scream "Daddy, stop!" But secretly I loved it. </p>
                <p> I think I have always been a daddy's girl. Or least wanted to be. Growing up I have always wanted my dad to love me as much I loved him. And I know in his own way he does. I know he loves me but I always felt not good enough. I still to this day rambel when I am around him. I have so much I want to say to him but when I get around him I am so scared he will say something like "Your Stupid." Which I know he will never say. But I have never wanted to make him mad. I go along with anything he says. Like he is the King or something. </p> 
                <h3>Growing Up</h3>
                <p> I was a thumb-sucker. Some kids like pacifiers, I always sucked my thumb. From utero, I came out with a big blister on my thumb. I found it to be a security blanket. I don't believe I was a nervous child. I believe I grew into a nervous adult. Growing up all I cared about was my parents, my sister and my favorite cat Lucky. We had a nice house, a big backyard, never had a dog. I always wanted a dog. But my dad was a cat person. We had one cat my sister got his name was Tiger. He was a orange striped taby cat. He peed on me when I first held him. He was our first cat. Very cat-like, nothing like my favorite cat Lucky. But a cat nevertheless. </p>
                <p> At about 3 years old I would sit with my butt straight up in the air and suck on my thumb. My dad would preceed to kick my butt over. Not in a mean way. It was fun. It is a very fond memory I have. Now at this time, me and mom were not very close. At least I don't remember us being all that close. To be honest I think I tortured her. Children see all but don't really understand what is going on. I saw the way my mom always got so nervous that my father would get mad that the house wasn't clean or the dinner was not made. I never understood why she would get so nervous. Being that young, I always looked at her like such a serious person. Like she could never let her guard down or be fun at all. </p>
                <h3>My mother</h3>
                <p> The memories I have of my mother are odd ones. I remember her never cursing just saying thing like "Sugar babies. darn'it or oh my goodness." Because in our house oh my gosh was too close to taking the lord's name in vain. When we would say gosh, it was time to get out the soap and she would scrub our tongues. She first tried vinegar but soon relized that that I actually didn't mind the taste of vinegar. Even though my father was the person to discipline, I was more attached to him then my own mother. </p>
                <h3>Church</h3>
                <p> She was your typical bible-thumping, stay-at-home mom. Every Wednesday and Sunday was church day. My mom was an awaunes leader. We have to memorize as many bible verses and get rewards. I would always do as many as I could the night before. I never understood church. At a young age I would ask questions like "What qualfies a person to go to heaven?" the answer was always "As long as you accept Jesus into your heart, you will go to heaven." That would always lead me to ask "If you do something bad after you ask Jesus into your heart what happens?" "You have to ask for forgiveness." and then the next question would be "Even if a really bad person asks Jesus into their heart, they would go to heaven?" "Yes" " What if they were lying?" "God knows." "How does god know?" "He knows all." After a girl I went to school with in Elementry school passed away, I was really sad, I thought what if she didn't ask Jesus into her heart, she would go to hell even though she never did anything bad. So I asked my mom " What happens if someone died and they didn't know about Jesus and weren't given the chance to ask Jesus into their heart, Like if a baby dies?" And she looked at me, stared at me and answered "  Well, Lauren they is a time limit, like all babies go to heaven." It always confused me and I remembering hoping that I die young enough that I meet that time limit, so I don't have to worry about going to hell. Hell was such a terrifying matter for me. When I got older I figured I would just ask Jesus into my heart right before I die. I mean I tried really hard to get into the whole church thing. I just didn't understand so much. I didn't understand why a god that is so amazing and loving would punish Eve with such a grudge that it hurts all women in the future. By tried I mean I really tried, I got bapitized at least twice. Every night when I got scared I would pray to god that all my sins would be forgiven. That he would take the bad dreams away. My mom when she got upset that I was throwing a temper tantrum she would 1. Sing opera and 2. She would pray very loudly to take the devil and demons away from this house. </p>
                <p> My parents always thought that if we did certain fads, such as going to church, getting bikes, digging a pool or moving away from the neighborhood. We would change and be a happy family. My father would always say "we did this and this and we are still exactly the same." My mother would always say back "We are the same people though." </p>
                <h3>Temper Tantrums</h3>
                <p>My anger, screaming fits have always been a part of my life. Even to this day. I got overwhelmed and don't know what to say. You know when you watch those movies and if the main character just said something a little different, they wouldn't break up. You yell at the TV saying come on just say what you just told your friend, he loves you! I feel like that is my typical life. I have always had trouble getting the words out of my mouth. I feel like if I could just get the words out, my life would go so much smoother. I once thought that my brain just didn't know to transfer the words to my mouth. So my life has consisted of screaming instead of saying what is really on my mind. I feel like I don't say what I really think because the words don't come out. My brain thinks to fast and then I forget or can't properly think correctly to complete a sentence. And when I get overwhelmed or crazy my brain stops all function and all I can do is scream and hit myself. It has always been such a big embaressment for me. I have always felt so ashamed that I act like this way. My mom would always say why do you act like this way around me and when your out in public your fine. But truthfully in public if I get upset my brain feels like it will explode. When I get super upset I feel like screaming is the only way to stop myself for throwing myself of a roof. I have never been homosidal but when I have my episodes (as my mother likes to call it) I will hit myself, scratch myself and if I have scissors I have been known to cut my hair. All the while knowing I am going to be so upset.</p>
                <p> I think I got my outwarded anger from my father. When he gets angry he shouts and curses and spits on the floor. He has thrown chairs and hit walls.  My mother on the other hand inwardly gets angry. You never know she is angry until she explodes and that normally involves bad-mouthing you like a teenager. </p>
                <h3> My Sister</h3>
                <p>Me and my sister never really got along. Although all I wanted was to hang out with her friends. Most of the time when she would go hang out with her friends, like a sleepover. I would secretly pack a bag and hide in the back of the van. And I would beg my mom to talk to the my sisters friends mom and ask if I could sleepover.
                And they would almost always let me because her friends liked me. They would do my make-up and play with my hair like I was a doll. One time we had a sleepover at my sister's friend's house named Nikki. And there was like 4 or 5 people there. We were playing dare or something like that. And we were doing stupid dares like go in a dark room and stare at this poricion doll for 2 minutes. It was so scary at the time! I was such a scaredy cat. One time I woke up in the middle of the night and forgot that I was at a friends house and screamed for my mom. I never really had sleepovers without my sister. I mean I did but I was always really scared that I would be the last to go to sleep. That always scared me. For a while if I went to a birthday sleepover I would have my mom pick me up really late, probably like 10 or 11 or something like that. But my sister was never scared like that. Instead she would always scare me, but once in while if she was feeling nice I would be aloud to go in her bed with her at night instead of waking up my parents because I would always wake up in the middle of the night and scream for my mom and if she didn't come I would build up the courage to sprint down the hallway to my parents room. </p>
                <p> A very fond memory I have of my sister is teaching my cursive. I was probably in 1st grade and she was in 3rd or 4th. She was just teaching all the cursive and thought "Wow my big sister is so cool!" I always looked up to her. I would always say my big sister taught me this or that. It was a big topic of conversion growing up. We were super close. Even though I know I bugged her so much. </p>
