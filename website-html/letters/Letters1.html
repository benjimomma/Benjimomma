            <h5>Pregnancy & Labor</h5>
            <p> When I found out I was pregnant, I knew it! I knew it before the stick would turn pink. I found out on a Friday. Michael was very scared. As any soon to be father would be.. But he came around in a matter of minutes. I thought to myself.. <em> This is going to be amazing, we are so in love and it will work out perfectly </em>  Then I thought about Labor. Which is something I have always been very scared about. But I have always wanted kids. So I never wanted to experience labor. I guess the scariest part for me is to be ripped open. For most I hear it's the epidural but for me definately the ripping me open part and maybe the pooping myself part crossed my mind.</p>

            <h5>Loss</h5>
            <p> I used Pregnancy as a reason to get super fat and not worry about counting calories. I figured the breastfeeding would make up for it. For whatever reason. Well fast forward to 12 weeks pregnant. We get a knock on the door at about 5 am. It is the FBI taking your father away. So there I am all alone, pregnant and alone. So in comes my mom. Before this we were close. I mean me and your father lived with her for almost 5 years. But this made us even closer. She was there for me when your father couldn't be. She was and is my rock. She went to all the ultrasounds with me. Heard all my worries, fears and anything at all. </p>
            <p> I was so nervous to not have your father. I mean we hadn't been apart in 5 years. Someone that I wanted so badly to be apart of something so new to me. I mean there were times where I wanted my alone time but I never thought that he would just be gone.</p>

            <h5>Finding a friend in my mom</h5>
            <p> So it was just my mom and I and she was amazing. I had quit my job and thought about nursing school but shortly realized that it was not for me. I don't want to be like everyone else and work work work and get no recognision. I hear how my mom is so unappreciated at work and I have had jobs like that and hated it. Why would I want that for my career? I mean it was obvious!</p>

            <h5>Finding out the sex</h5>
            <p> At around 19 weeks pregnant I found out I was having a boy. I knew it in my heart that I was having a boy but I kept having dreams I was having a girl. I think because having a girl was so scary to me. I didn't want her to be like my mom, my sister or even me. I don't think I could handle it! But I found out you were going to be a baby boy, I was so excited. </p> 
            <h5>Telling my Father</h5>
            <p> Then I had to tell my dad. I was so scared that he would be mad. I have to give myself pep talks. But in the end he didn't blow up or get mad. I could tell he wasn't the happiest but he smiled and was okay with it. </p>
            <p> a couple months later he took me garage sale shopping. There is a huge garage sale in Fishhawk twice a year. We hit the jackpot, got most of your clothes. Got the white bassinet that you loved to sleep in, but out grew within 2 months. The swing that the motor broke within 4 months. a changing table that hasn't failed us yet. Some amazing Baby Einstein DVDs that you love. And so many adorable clothes that you grew out of way too quickly. </p>

            <h5>Annabel</h5>
            <p> So my life was feeling my little baby boy wiggle and hiccup inside me. And Alexander was so sweet, always laid his head on my body. We had another dog named Annabel. She was your dad's favorite, but after she left and I got pregnant she changed. She was hard to handle and nipped a couple people. She would attack Amelia for just standing there. So she is now living on a farm in Florida somewhere and looks so happy to be able to run around. </p>

            <h5>The Wedding</h5>
            <p> I went to my cousins wedding, it was really fun and my first time since I got pregnant seeing my Grandma and being away from the dogs and my mom. I wasn't going to go but decided to go at the last second. I spent the weekend with my Dad and his wife and my Grandma. I always love spending time with my Grandma. She was so nice and we got to share a room and talk. It was fun to pig out and have fun for a night. </p>
            <h5>Thanksgiving</h5>
            <p> Thanksgiving came and went and I didn't do anything. I stayed at home and watched the dogs. Then my sister came over and we got pizza and watched Jessica Jones, I still don't understand that show--maybe I just didn't like it to much. But then we went to the baby shower. </p>

            <h5>The Baby Shower</h5>
            <p> The baby shower was a lot of fun. It was more of a family affair but that is fine because I have never really had many friends. I just don't get along with people very much. I don't have a good filter and my brain doesn't think much before I speak. At the baby shower, it was so much fun. We did some games, ate some food and the cake was amazing! We got lots of gifts and so many books. I asked for books instead of cards. And boy, we got so many books. </p>

            <h5>The Hospital</h5>
            <p> Then Christmas came... I couldn't sleep at all the night before. I was in so much pain and I couldn't pee at all. I called my mom and cried. She was at work and left to bring me to the hospital. I thought at the time, it was probably just a UTI. I got the worst Midwife! I hated her from the first time I ever met her. She was a rude, old, crabby woman. One of the meanest women I have ever met.<span> SideNote</span> I remember she was the first midwife I saw when I found out I was pregnant. She scared me so much. Imagine an old overweight woman, a woman that is supposed to be an extremely educated person. But when she "looks at you" you don't know if she is actually looking at you and not to even mention she was wearing a skort. You know the skirt and shorts thing, we all wore in elementry school. Yes, that is what she was wearing and I probably wouldn't have even noticed but she was sitting on her stool with her legs wide open. Like a man relaxing and drinking a beer. And trust me I don't normally even care about that stuff as long as you are respectful and a good doctor. But she was very rude. She told me I had nast, digusting urine so of course I had a UTI. So I just said okay cool. Turned out I had no infection. I had a kidney problem. When I finally felt so much pain that I decided to give it another try and go back to the dreaded hospital. Turned out after a kidney ultrasound they found a 9mm kidney stone in my right kidney. I stayed there for a week and they wanted to do a kidney stent. I passed two stones. I went home for a couple days and decided to come back because of the pain. I stayed until the induction on the 26th of January. </p>
