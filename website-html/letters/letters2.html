                   <h5>Month 1</h5>
        <p class="paragraph">From the day he was born, he has been such a great little baby. Being so great and a joy to be around only crying when he was hungry or sleepy. My mom has been the best though being such a great help. I didn't even know how to change a diaper when I had him. In this month, he went to have his circumcision, he also spent a weekend with me at my dads while I was still recuperating from the surgery and my mom had to work. He went to the hospital with me twice because I had a bad infection where I had the C-section. I was still getting off the pain meds. When they say it is hard to come off, it is. It's not like I going through withdraw but it made me feel empty without it. I felt like I needed even when I knew I didn't. </p>

        <h5>First days after delivery</h5>
            <p class="paragraph"> From the first hours he was whisked away from me due to low blood sugar. I was still recovering so I wasn't all there, I would say. As soon as he was in the NICU I went to see him but first was my after surgery removal of the catheter. Not fun but not as bad as I thought it would be. The worst part was standing up for the first time after my C-section. It felt like My stomach was going to fall out of my body. But I knew all I wanted was to breastfeed. That was actually the first thing I said after I got pregnant. For some reason that is what I wanted so bad. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't breastfeed. Mostly, for saving money but my mom is a nurse with mommy and babies and she always said it is the best thing for the baby. And that kind of always stuck with me. Well, to make things short even though I had to get out of bed every 2-4 hours I still did everything I could to make sure I could breastfeed. I pumped whenever I could and expressed as much as I could. The baby wasn't able to latch on to start because we had to use a nippleshield. He couldn't latch on that well and I hated the nippleshield. When we finally left the hospital after Ben's billirubin was back to normal. I remember I could barely lift up my leg high enough to get in the car. I also remember how different the nurses and doctors treat you when you are pregnant compared to when you have the baby. I felt like I could do no wrong before I had the baby and then as soon as the baby was born they were doing everything to push me out. Probably I was just so scared to leave the care of the hospital that I felt so weird.</p>

            <h5>Hormones</h5>
             <p class="paragraph">When they say your hormones are going crazy after you give birth, THEY ARE RIGHT! I had never felt so out of place in my own body. Even more than I did when I was a teenager. I felt like I was going through some type of mid-life crisis. I did so much reflecting on my 21 years on earth. And I started thinking of everything I thought I would be missing out on, now that I am a mother. But truthfully I didn't party or hang out and go out with friends before so all the changed was a baby was there instead of my dogs. It was a crazy 3 days for me. My mom was right in the midst of watching Nurse Jackie and that show made me cry so hard. Everything made me feel so sad. I tried watching one of my favorite shows, The 100 and I cringed. I had a scary feeling in my body. I felt frightened when I watched the show. Now I still can't even watch that show and Nurse Jackie still makes me feel sick to watch it. But needless to say I thought I had lost it. I have been down before, and a long time ago my parents thought I might be Bi-Polar, so my mind automatically went to "Oh my god, I must have post-partum depression" I even had the worst experience at my post-partum check-up, I had a mid-wife at the time I found very rude, and she had me fill out a paper. It pretty much asked how sad you are, do you cry often? pretty standard. So I decided that if I had post-partum depression I want to really be as honest as I can. SO i filled it out probably more honest than most people do. As I soon as I got back there with the mid-wife she said that I have post-partum depression and that she could have my committed and I lost it, I started balling my eyes out. Crying so hard there was no way I could talk or really breathe. I mean this wasn't out of the normal for me. But it had only been like 3 days. I was a hot mess. I was still extremely swollen and so large and couldn't walk barely from the surgery. I remember I was so determined to get a hands-free pumping bra and a premie-flow nipple for the bottle. So my mom took me and Benjamin to BuyBuyBaby and for some reason I had to go in. I couldn't put my shoes completely on because my feet were huge so put my toes in the shoes and walked on my toes. Remember I had just left the hospital we hadn't even came home yet. I was in so much pain that this lady in the parking lot stopped me and asked if I was okay because I crying so hard. She probably thought I had been seriously hurt or that I was going insane. When I got into the store I got everything I needed and I tried to leave and the automatic door wouldn't open. The lady at the front desk was looking at me like that is not the way to leave. I was so distrout I forgot that the door you go in is not the actually door you go through to get back out and I started crying and saying I just had a C-section, I cannot do this. And the lady finally said you just have the pull the door open. So I did and I left. When I got back in the car and told my mom everything that had happened  my mom said "I probably should have gone in." And the funny thing was a few weeks later we went back and some lady said did you come in here after your c-section? And I was so embarressed I just said Yes and left.  </p>
