            <p> So this is my story. The love of my life. The father of my child. The person that makes me nervous, flutter and spat random words in utter urgency of making him happy. The person I can never say the right thing to at the right time. He has been the big love in my life. I have grown up in this relationship. It all started 5 years ago. </p>
            <h4>The Start </h4>
            <p> May 2011, seems so long ago. But I remember it so vividly. I was at AA. I am sure I will get to that eventually. I was coming up on one year sober. I had been going to the AA club for almost a year and I had just turned 16 that January. I had a friend there named Erin. She was 17 and I guess it was like we had to be friends. I was mentoring her and us being so young it was kind of the untold that we would be friends. Well, we had been hanging out for probably at least 5 months. I would have considered her my best friend. She drove me to all the meetings and we hung out all the time. I called her mom, mom. And it was so awesome to have a friend my own age again. Being there everyone was so much older and expected me to act older, Most my friends were in there 30s and they didn't look at me like I was 15, they looked at me like an adult and in most ways I acted like one. Until I did something that showed my age, like me talking behing someones back or flirting with guys I had no business flirting with. I mean I look back on things I said and I cringe at the thought of what people must of thought of me. 
            One day around the 3rd or 4th of May is when I met him. So I am just sitting around outside of AA, not many people were there, it was inbetween meetings. I decided to call Erin and beg her to come and get me because I was terribly bored. She said she was at the mall or something like that but she had her dad's truck and didn't have room for me. But I begged her, and she said she would drop me off at my house. I remember I was at the heaviest weight of my life yet and I was wearing a Victoria's Secret PINK sleep shirt and shorts. My hair was thrown up and I don't believe I had any makeup on probably just whatever I was wearing the night before, some messed up eye liner or whatever. Needless to say I didn't look my best. But she came and never told me who she was with. You could tell she was into him. But man this guy was gorgeous. I mean these stricking blue eyes and almost black hair, in a long rocker style. He had the I don't give a sh*t look, which was very hot. I mean he was so gorgeous. I had never seen him before and I knew that because I would have remembered him. It was like a movie, i got weak in the knees, I played everything so cool. Normally I would try so hard but with him I had this overwhelming calming feeling that everything was going to be
